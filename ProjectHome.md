CopyRemote[remotefile, localfile] copies remotefile from a URL to localfile. CopyRemote is similar to the Mathematica URLSave function, but adds a progress bar by default and provides additional utility functions like URLQ and ULRFileByteCount.

CopyRemote is JLink based and works in Mathematica 7, 8 or 9
